<p>I'm glad you're looking at this page.&nbsp; You really shouldn't trust a
computer program to calculate your contact lenses unless you know exactly how
the calculations are done.&nbsp; There's definitely nothing magic about these
calculators:&nbsp; The formulas and the concepts that are being employed are the
same ones that you would use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/philosopher.gif" align="left" width="189" height="131"></p>
<p>However, there are a lot of different fitting philosophies out there for each
one of these types of contact lense<img border="0" src="../images/philosopher2.gif" align="right" width="185" height="132">s.&nbsp;
Each one has it's merits and I had
to choose just one for each type of lens (actually, I couldn't decide for the
spherical RGPs so I chose two). I want you to know exactly which
philosophies were employed in these calculations so you can decide if they are
in agreement with the way you want to do things.&nbsp; If they are, great.&nbsp; Go ahead and use the calculators and maybe save yourself a little
time.&nbsp; If there're not, don't use the calculators and stick to what you
prefer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be aware that <b>this program has limitations!&nbsp; </b>It's stupid,
actually. It doesn't take into account pupil size.&nbsp; It doesn't take into
account lid position.&nbsp; It doesn't even take into account palpebral aperture,
lid tension, iris diameter, or any of the other factors a contact lens fitter
needs to evaluate.&nbsp; And it can't look at the lens on the eye and decide if
it's fitting appropriately and, if not, what should be modified.&nbsp; In fact,
all it can do is the simplest mathematics, which is the easiest part of the
whole process.&nbsp; <i>Only you, the professional, experienced eye doctor can
make the ultimate decision</i> on which lens a patient should leave your office
with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are some compelling studies demonstrating the advantages
of&nbsp; <i>diagnostic</i> fitting (as opposed to the <i>empirical</i>
recommendations that this program is making).&nbsp; Largely, these studies
indicate that diagnostic
fitting yields greater patient satisfaction and less contact lens
refits.&nbsp; If you have the resources, using diagnostic lenses for the initial
contact lens fits will be superior to anything a computer program can do for you,
especially with the more complicated toric lenses.</p>
<p>The concepts used in this program are a conglomeration of ideas from the
following sources: Milton Hom's <i>Manual of Contact Lens Prescribing and
Fitting</i>, Bennet &amp; Henry's <i>Clinical Manual of Contact Lenses</i>,
Carol Schwartz's <i>Specialty Contact Lens: A Fitter's Guide</i>, Fannin &amp;
Grovsner's <i>Clinical Optics,</i> and my lecture notes from my contact lens
classes at ICO.</p>

        <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Bitoric lenses are usually the most popular
        choice when there are larger amounts of corneal astigmatism.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When verifying bitoric lenses, the radiuscope mires will
        come into focus at two different points, corresponding to the two base
        curves.&nbsp; The lensometer mires will also focus at two different
        points, corresponding with the two different powers.&nbsp; The magnitude
        of cylinder measured on the lensometer and the radiuscope should be
        similar (this is not true of back toric RGPs - discussed below).</p>

        <p>Back toric lenses induce cylinder on the eye.&nbsp; As a result, the
        power in air (on a lensometer) will be different than on the eye.&nbsp;
        Largely, the cylinder is determined by refractive index of the contact
        lens, which, of course, is determined by the lens material.&nbsp; The
        conversions can be based on the following table:

        <p>Example:&nbsp; You have a FS/A lens that has a back surface toricity
        of 41.00/44.00 as measure on the radiuscope.&nbsp; The base curve span
        is 3.00 D, so it should measure 3 x 1.32 = 3.96, or approximately 4.00 D
        of cylinder on the lensometer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>* This is a good way to determine if an unknown toric RGP lens is a
        back toric lens or a bitoric lens.&nbsp; This formula will apply to a
        back toric lens.&nbsp; However, a bitoric lens will measure similar
        cylinder amounts on the radiuscope and the lensometer.&nbsp;

        <p><b>Other Info:</b></p>
        <p>Front toric lenses are designed to be stabilized with a prism ballast.  If
        they do not rotate correctly, the prism can be increased or it can be truncated.&nbsp;
        Because it is difficult to achieve rotational stability with these lenses, it is usually recommended that you try a soft toric lens first (unless it's contraindicated).
        A higher dk (>50) is recommended, as the prism makes these lenses thicker.  Also,
        small diameter lenses tend to decenter inferiorly because of the
        increased mass and may not give enough pupil coverage.&nbsp;
        Consequently, a larger diameter lenses may be indicated. </p>
