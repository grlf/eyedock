<h3 title="How The Contact Lens Calculator Works">How It Works</h3>

<p>
    I'm glad you're looking at this page. You really shouldn't trust a
    computer program to calculate your contact lenses unless you know exactly how
    the calculations are done. There's definitely nothing magic about these
    calculators: The formulas and the concepts that are being employed are the
    same ones that you would use.
    However, there are a lot of different fitting philosophies out there for each
    one of these types of contact lenses.
    Each one has it's merits and I had
    to choose just one for each type of lens (actually, I couldn't decide for the
    <img src="modules/Tools/pnimages/philosopher_01.gif" style="float:left;width:189px;height:131px;border:0;" alt="" />    spherical RGPs so I chose two). I want you to know exactly which
    philosophies were employed in these calculations so you can decide if they are
    in agreement with the way you want to do things. If they are, great. Go ahead and 
    use the calculators and maybe save yourself a little
    time. If there're not, don't use the calculators and stick to what you
    prefer.</p>
<p>
    Be aware that <strong>this program has limitations! </strong>It's stupid,
    actually. It doesn't take into account pupil size. It doesn't take into
    account lid position. It doesn't even take into account palpebral aperture,
    lid tension, iris diameter, or any of the other factors a contact lens fitter
    needs to evaluate. And it can't look at the lens on the eye and decide if
    it's fitting appropriately and, if not, what should be modified. In fact,
    <img src="modules/Tools/pnimages/philosopher_02.gif" style="float:right;width:185px;height:132px;border:0;" alt="" />    all it can do is the simplest mathematics, which is the easiest part of the
    whole process. <em>Only you, the professional, experienced eye doctor can
    make the ultimate decision</em> on which lens a patient should leave your office
    with.</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, there are some compelling studies demonstrating the advantages
    of <em>diagnostic</em> fitting (as opposed to the <em>empirical</em>
    recommendations that this program is making). Largely, these studies
    indicate that diagnostic
    fitting yields greater patient satisfaction and less contact lens
    refits. If you have the resources, using diagnostic lenses for the initial
    contact lens fits will be superior to anything a computer program can do for you,
    especially with the more complicated toric lenses.</p>
<p>
    The concepts used in this program are a conglomeration of ideas from the
    following sources: Milton Hom's <em>Manual of Contact Lens Prescribing and
    Fitting</em>, Bennett &amp; Henry's <em>Clinical Manual of Contact Lenses</em>,
    Carol Schwartz's <em>Specialty Contact Lens: A Fitter's Guide</em>, Fannin &amp;
    Grovsner's <em>Clinical Optics,</em> and my lecture notes from my contact lens
    classes at ICO. </p>

    thoughts, advice, or comments, please <a href="index.php?module=Contact" title="Make Contact">contact me</a>.</p>

            <strong>Other Info:</strong><br /><br />
            Bitoric lenses are usually the most popular choice when there are larger amounts of corneal astigmatism.<br /><br />
            When verifying bitoric lenses, the radiuscope mires will come into focus at two different points, corresponding to the two base curves. The lensometer mires will also focus at two different points, corresponding with the two different powers. The magnitude of cylinder measured on the lensometer and the radiuscope should be similar (this is not true of back toric RGPs - discussed below).<br /><br />
            Spherical Power Effect (SPE) and Cylinder Power Effect (CPE) are trial lens sets that are available for diagnostic fittings.<br /><br />

            Back toric lenses induce cylinder on the eye. As a result, the power in air (on a lensometer) will be different than on the eye. Largely, the cylinder is determined by refractive index of the contact lens, which, of course, is determined by the lens material. The conversions can be based on the following table:<br /><br />

            Example: You have a FS/A lens that has a back surface toricity of 41.00/44.00 as measure on the radiuscope. The base curve span is 3.00 D, so it should measure 3 x 1.32 = 3.96, or approximately 4.00 D of cylinder on the lensometer.<br /><br />
            * This is a good way to determine if an unknown toric RGP lens is a back toric lens or a bitoric lens. This formula will apply to a back toric lens. However, a bitoric lens will measure similar cylinder amounts on the radiuscope and the lensometer.<br /><br />

                <li>The lens power is determined by creating an optical cross. This is done by taking the corneal curvature in each meridian, subtracting the base curve, and adding the (vertexed) manifest refraction for that meridian. The optical cross is then converted to a plus cylinder prescription (because the cylindrical component of these lenses is on the front).

            Front toric lenses are designed to be stabilized with a prism ballast.  If they do not rotate correctly, the prism can be increased or it can be truncated. Because it is difficult to achieve rotational stability with these lenses, it is usually recommended that you try a soft toric lens first (unless it's contraindicated). A higher dk (>50) is recommended, as the prism makes these lenses thicker.  Also, small diameter lenses tend to decenter inferiorly because of the increased mass and may not give enough pupil coverage. Consequently, a larger diameter lenses may be indicated. <br /><br />
