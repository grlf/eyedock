<h3 title="How Employee Incentive Programs Work">How It Works</h3>

<div>

<p>Incentive plans can work because a well-designed plan will address the basic,
human-nature question, <em>What's in it for me?</em> There is no perfect incentive plan
and each has its advantages and disadvantages.  You have to find a plan that is truly
a win-win formula that staff will respond to and the doctor can smile each
time a profit sharing check is written and signed.</p>
<p>This tool, based on a formula created by practice management advisor and professional speaker
Gale Stoner, provides monthly rewards to staff members for increased production and
collections.</p>
<p>Prior to instituting the incentive program, the doctor/owner should make it clear
to all staff what the value of each variable will be for the calculation and how
they may change from time to time.</p>
<p>Filling out the left hand side of this form will help establish a
production goal for a three month period based on the same period the previous year.
First, enter the month and year for which you want to calculate a goal. Then, enter
the gross collections for the most recent three months the previous year. If necessary,
change the inflation factor and enter a reasonable growth rate. After clicking the
&quot;Calculate Goal&quot; button, the result will be the target for the three month
period's average monthly collections.</p>
<p>At the end of the month the right hand side of the form can be filled out to
calculate employee profit sharing. If necessary, adjust the approximate percentage
of gross going to staff compensation and then enter the number of full time staff
 members participating in the program. After entering the gross collections from
 the most recent three months, click the &quot;Calculate Incentives&quot; button.
 The resultant answer will describe the total profit sharing and each employee's share.</p>
