<h3 title="How The Oblique Crossed Cylinders Calculator Works">How It Works</h3>

<div>
<p>Several people have asked how this calculator works and why lens
rotation should be taken into account. In essence,
the calculator first adds the amount of rotation to the axis of
the contact lens. This is the only way to know how the power meridians 
are going to line up with the meridians of the over refraction.
Once we know how these meridians relate to each other we can then 
apply the traditional oblique crossed cylinder equations. 
After this calculation, we know what power and what meridians make the 
patient reach their best corrected vision. However, since the trial lens should 
rotate just like the original, the calculator then subtracts the angle of 
lens rotation. The final result is a recommendation for a lens
that is expected to rotate like the original lens.
