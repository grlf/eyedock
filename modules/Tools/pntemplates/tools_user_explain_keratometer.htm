<h3 title="How Extending The Keratometer Range Works">How It Works</h2>

<div>
    <p>Sometimes a patient has a corneal curvature so steep (keratoconus) or flat (post-LASIK or PKP)
     that they're beyond the range of a conventional keratometer. You can extend the keratometer range
     by taping a trial lens over the central aperture on the patient's side of instrument (be sure not 
     occlude the mires). For steep corneas, use a +1.25 lens. For flat ones, use a -1.00 lens. Multiply
     the K readings by the following conversion factors to get the extended values.</p>
    
    <p>It's a simple calculation, but this is something that comes up so rarely that most of us don't have access to the conversion factors when we need them.</p>
    
    <p>Thanks to Jay Highland, O.D. who suggested this calculator and researched the conversion factors. </p>
