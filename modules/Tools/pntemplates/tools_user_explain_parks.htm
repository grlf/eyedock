<h3 title="How The Park's Three-Step Test Works">How It Works</h3>

<div>
<p>The Park's Three-Step Test is used to isolate the paretic muscle in acquired vertical diplopia.</p>
<p>The Park's Three-Step Test is not intended to be used for assessing horizontal diplopia, nor will it 
provide useful information in a restrictive strabismus or neuromyopathic conditions. This test is most
appropriate for neuroparalytic disorders. Furthermore, be aware that patients who have had extraocular 
muscle surgery may not have predicatble results.</p>
<p>The Park's Three-Step Test works by observing the vertical deviation in primary gaze, 
left and right gaze, and right and left head tilt. Where the hyperdeviations are of the 
greatest magnitude indicate where the paretic muscle should be working maximally. By 
comparing these deviations with each muscle's known primary field of action we can systematically 
eliminate them until there is only one muscle remaining.</p>
